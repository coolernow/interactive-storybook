![Final Page Example](https://github.com/junior-devleague/interactive-storybook/blob/master/assets/example.png)

## Objective

Use **HTML Elements**, **CSS Styles** and **CSS Animations** to create a storybook that the user can interact with!

## Prerequisites

To complete this project, students should have the following:
* Basic understanding of HTML structures and attributes.
* Basic understanding of CSS Keyframes.
* Basic understanding of Flexbox.

## Your Challenge

### Part I

To complete Part I, fulfill the following requirements:

1. Set up your project file structure through the command line.
2. Create the following:
* HTML file
* CSS file
* assets folder (from this folder)
3. Link all of your files correctly.

### Part II HTML

To complete Part II, fulfill the following requirements:

1. Create a ```div``` with an ```id``` of "container". **Inside of this div**, create the following:

* ```div``` with a ```class``` of "area"
  * ```div``` with a ```class``` of "innerarea"
    * ```img``` with the ```src``` to the "panel1.png" file.
    * ```img``` with the ```src``` to the "panel2.png" file.

This part should appear like this in your HTML file:

``` HTML
<div class="area">
  <div class="innerarea">
    <img src="assets/panel1.png" alt="">
    <img src="assets/panel2.png" alt="">
  </div>
</div>
```

**See how things are nested with indentation? Indentation is important to show what elements belong to what.**

We will continue to create similar patterns.

**Inside of the div with id of container, continue to create the following:**

* ```div``` with a ```class``` of "area"
  * ```div``` with a ```class``` of "innerarea"
    * ```img``` with the ```src``` to the "panel3.png" file.
    * ```img``` with the ```src``` to the "panel4.png" file.
